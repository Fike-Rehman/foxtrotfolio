RobinTTSApp is a cross-platform text-to-speech (TTS) application that transforms written text into lifelike speech using cutting-edge AI voice synthesis. Designed with flexibility in mind, it seamlessly integrates with cloud-based services like ElevenLabs and also supports open-source alternatives such as Zonos for local deployment.


ðŸš€ Features
AI-Powered Voice Synthesis: Leverages ElevenLabs' advanced TTS API for high-quality, emotionally expressive speech generation.
Modular Architecture: Easily switch between different TTS engines, including local models like Zonos.
Cross-Platform Compatibility: Built with C# and TypeScript, ensuring smooth operation across various platforms.
User-Friendly Interface: Intuitive UI for effortless text input and audio playback.
Custom Voice Characters: Includes two default voice characters (one male, one female) and supports easy training and integration of new custom characters.

The application's frontend is built using the **React** JavaScript library and powered by **Vite.js** for a modern development workflow. It provides a user friendly interface with intuitive UI for effortless text input, voice character selection, and audio playback. 
The backend of the application is a thoughtfully designed, scalable, and extensible **Microsoft .NET 8 Web API** that powers the applicationâ€™s intelligent voice generation engine. It serves as the bridge between the frontend interface and the AI text-to-speech (TTS) services like ElevenLabs. It can also be easily configured to use a different cloud based voice generation engine like **Azure Text-to-speech** or even a locally hosted AI model like Zonos.
