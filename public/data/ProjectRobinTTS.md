RobinTTSApp is a cross-platform text-to-speech (TTS) application that transforms written text into lifelike speech using cutting-edge AI voice synthesis. Designed with flexibility in mind, it seamlessly integrates with cloud-based services like ElevenLabs and also supports open-source alternatives such as Zonos for local deployment.

Application features AI-Powered Voice Synthesis that Leverages ElevenLabs' advanced TTS API for high-quality, emotionally expressive speech generation by default.
But it allows to easily switch between different TTS engines, including local models like Zonos. It offers a Intuitive UI for effortless text input, voice character selection and audio playback.
